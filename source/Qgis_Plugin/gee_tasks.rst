Once you have submitted a calculation using MISLAND, it is sent to 
Google Earth Engine to run the calculations in the cloud. To view the Google 
Earth Engine (GEE) tasks you have running, and to download your results, select 
the cloud with the arrow facing down icon highlighted above. This will open up the `Download results 
from Earth Engine` dialog box.
   
Click `Refresh List` to show all the tasks you have submitted and their status.

Users can view their current and previous tasks here. the table shows the
task name provided by the user, which analysis is running (job), the start time 
and end time of when the task was started and completed and whether or not the 
task was successful. The Details page outlines the different options the user 
chose for each task.

To download results to the computer once a task has finished, click on the task 
you are interested in downloading results for, then click `Download results`.
In the window that appears, choose the location in which to save the download. 
Note that some downloads might consist of multiple files - all of these files 
need to be kept together if the results are moved to a different location on 
the computer (or saved to a USB stick).
