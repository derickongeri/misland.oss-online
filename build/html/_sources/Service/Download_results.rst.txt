Exporting Outputs

Exporting outputs on the service is as simple and intuitive as all the other functions of the service. Users can download the maps, charts and data as will be discussed in this section of the documentation.

The map outputs for every coputatio on the service platform can be exported as an image file in either portrait or landscape mode.
