Sustainable Development Goal 15.3 intends to combat desertification, restore 
degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and 
floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world by 2030. In 
order to assess the progress to this goal, the agreed-upon indicator for SDG 
15.3 (proportion of land area degraded) is a combination of three 
sub-indicators: change in land productivity, change in land cover and change  
in soil organic carbon.
